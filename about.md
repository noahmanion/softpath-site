  <p class="lead">I'm Noah. I started Softpath to help growth teams stop guessing and start measuring.</p>
</div>

I've spent 13+ years in performance marketing, analytics, and marketing automation. I've managed paid acquisition from $1K/month to $1M/month across Meta, Google, and TikTok. I've implemented and configured tools like Segment, Klaviyo, HubSpot, ActiveCampaign, GA4, and GTM for companies at every stage.

What I've learned: most marketing teams have decent instincts but terrible infrastructure. They're making decisions based on data they can't trust, using tools that don't talk to each other, and optimizing to metrics that don't matter.

<div class="highlight-box">
  <h3>My approach is practical</h3>
  <p>I focus on what actually drives results: clean tracking, connected systems, and paid acquisition tied to real customer value.</p>
</div>

I work primarily with B2C and B2B2C companies: ecommerce brands, subscription businesses, and marketplaces. If you're running paid acquisition and want to actually know what's working, we should talk.
