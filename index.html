          Softpath helps B2C and B2B2C companies connect ad spend to real business outcomes, not platform vanity metrics.

        <p class="hero__body">
          Most growth teams are flying blind. Tracking is broken, attribution is a mess, and nobody trusts the numbers in the dashboard. We fix the infrastructure first, then help you scale paid acquisition with confidence.
