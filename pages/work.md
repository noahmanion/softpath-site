# Selected work

We don't publish logos or detailed case studies without permission, and most clients prefer to keep their growth infrastructure private. Here's a representative sample of the problems we solve and the outcomes we deliver.

<div class="work-grid">

## DTC Subscription Brand
### Tracking rebuild + paid acquisition

**The situation:** A subscription box company scaling quickly but flying blind. Their Meta ROAS looked great in-platform, but customer-level analysis showed true CAC was 40% higher than reported. Events were firing multiple times, attribution windows were misconfigured, and their subscription billing platform wasn't integrated with their analytics.

**What we did:** Complete tracking audit and rebuild. Implemented server-side conversion API for Meta with deduplication. Built a proper LTV model using actual subscription retention data. Restructured their Meta campaigns around true CAC targets rather than platform ROAS.

**The outcome:** Discovered they were systematically over-investing in channels that looked efficient but weren't. Reallocated spend based on real contribution margin, which initially meant spending less total while scaling the channels that actually worked. Within 6 months, they'd increased overall acquisition volume at a lower blended CAC.

## B2B2C Fintech Platform
### Analytics implementation

**The situation:** A fintech company with a two-sided marketplace model. They had data in Snowflake but no self-serve analytics for the marketing team. Every question required an engineering ticket. Attribution was nonexistent because their multi-touch, multi-stakeholder journey didn't fit standard models.

**What we did:** Built a custom attribution model that reflected their actual user journey, including the B2B sales motion that influenced consumer adoption. Created a marketing analytics layer in their BI tool that let the growth team answer their own questions. Implemented proper UTM governance and channel taxonomy.

**The outcome:** Marketing team went from waiting days for data to answering most questions themselves within minutes. Attribution model revealed that certain partnership channels were dramatically undervalued by last-touch attribution, which shifted budget allocation significantly. The CMO could finally explain marketing's contribution to the board without caveats.

## E-commerce Brand (Multi-SKU)
### Martech stack integration

**The situation:** A mid-size e-commerce brand with a messy stack that had grown organically over years. Klaviyo, Shopify, GA4, Meta pixel, Google Ads, a loyalty program, and a reviews platform, none of which shared consistent customer identity. Email personalization was limited because Klaviyo didn't know what customers had actually purchased (just what Shopify sent over, which wasn't everything).

**What we did:** Implemented Segment as a customer data layer. Unified identity across all touchpoints. Rebuilt event tracking to capture the full product interaction journey. Connected purchase and LTV data back to ad platforms for better optimization signals.

**The outcome:** Klaviyo finally had accurate purchase history, unlocking abandoned cart flows that actually worked and post-purchase sequences tailored to what customers bought. Meta campaigns could optimize to purchase value rather than just conversion events. They found and fixed a tracking gap that was causing 15% of purchases to not be attributed to any channel.

## SaaS Company (Product-Led Growth)
### Paid acquisition launch

**The situation:** A PLG SaaS company that had grown entirely through organic and word-of-mouth. They wanted to layer in paid acquisition but had never run ads before. Their free trial funnel was complex, and they weren't sure what to optimize for or how to measure success.

**What we did:** Designed their paid acquisition measurement framework from scratch. Implemented conversion tracking for the full funnel (signup → activation → paid conversion). Built a Google Ads program focused on high-intent search. Ran incrementality tests to validate that paid was actually driving new customers, not just capturing existing demand.

**The outcome:** Paid became a meaningful acquisition channel without cannibalizing organic. They learned that brand search was almost entirely cannibalistic (cut it), while non-brand intent terms drove genuine incremental signups. Established a measurement framework they could use as they expanded to other channels.

## Consumer App
### Tracking repair + measurement

**The situation:** A mobile-first consumer app whose tracking had degraded over multiple iOS updates and app redesigns. Their numbers were so unreliable that the marketing team had essentially stopped looking at them. They were making spend decisions based on instinct.

**What we did:** Full mobile tracking audit covering iOS and Android. Rebuilt their MMP implementation with proper SKAdNetwork configuration. Implemented a modeled attribution approach that accounted for iOS privacy limitations. Created an executive dashboard that showed acquisition metrics people could actually trust.

**The outcome:** Marketing team regained confidence in their data for the first time in over a year. Identified that one of their paid channels had negative incrementality (it was cannibalizing organic installs). Shifted budget to channels with proven incrementality, improving overall acquisition efficiency by approximately 25%.
