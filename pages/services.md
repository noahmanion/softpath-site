# We fix marketing infrastructure and run acquisition you can actually measure.

Most growth problems are actually measurement problems in disguise. You can't optimize what you can't measure, and you can't trust decisions based on data you know is wrong.

We specialize in three interconnected areas: getting your tracking and tools working correctly, running paid acquisition tied to real business outcomes, and building analytics systems that tell you what's actually happening.

## Marketing Infrastructure Audit

**The starting point for most engagements.**

Before we touch your ad accounts or build new dashboards, we need to understand what's actually happening in your marketing stack. The audit is a 2-3 week diagnostic that covers your tracking implementation, your martech architecture, and your paid acquisition setup.

**What we examine:** Event tracking accuracy and completeness across web and app. Data flow between your marketing tools, CRM, and analytics platforms. Pixel health and conversion API implementation. Attribution configuration and its alignment with how your business actually works. Current paid acquisition structure, targeting, and measurement approach.

**What you get:** A detailed findings document that identifies what's broken, what's misconfigured, and what's missing entirely. Prioritized recommendations ranked by impact and effort. A roadmap for fixing the critical issues, whether you implement it yourself or bring us in to do it.

The audit pays for itself. Every client we've audited has discovered tracking gaps, measurement errors, or wasted spend they didn't know existed.

## Martech & Tracking Implementation

**Making your tools actually work together.**

Your marketing stack probably includes a CDP (or should), an analytics platform, ad pixels, email/CRM tools, and various point solutions. In theory, they all connect. In practice, data is duplicated, events fire inconsistently, and nobody's quite sure which numbers to believe.

We fix that.

**What we do:** Implement or repair event tracking across web, mobile, and server-side. Configure and optimize your CDP (we work extensively with Segment, but also Rudderstack and others). Set up GA4 properly, including the parts Google makes unnecessarily complicated. Implement conversion APIs for Meta, Google, and TikTok to maintain signal quality as cookies disappear. Build the integrations that connect your marketing data to your CRM and business systems.

**How we work:** We handle implementation directly, working in your codebase and tools. For companies with engineering resources, we can spec the work and QA the implementation instead. Either way, you end up with tracking you can trust.

## Paid Acquisition Management

**Campaigns optimized to business outcomes, not platform metrics.**

We manage paid acquisition across Meta, Google, and TikTok for B2C and B2B2C companies. The difference between us and most paid managers: we optimize to actual customer value, not in-platform ROAS.

Platform metrics lie. They over-attribute, they double-count, and they're increasingly modeled rather than measured. We build measurement systems that show true acquisition cost and customer value, then use that data to make real optimization decisions.

**What we manage:** Full-funnel Meta campaigns from prospecting through retargeting. Google Ads including Search, Shopping, Performance Max, and YouTube. TikTok for brands where the audience and creative fit. Creative strategy and iteration based on actual performance data, not platform "best practices."

**How we approach it:** We start by fixing measurement (see above) so we know what's actually working. We structure campaigns for incrementality testing, not just efficiency theater. We focus on contribution margin and LTV, not vanity ROAS. We communicate in business terms, not ad platform jargon.

We've managed monthly spend from $1K to $1M+. We're agnostic on budget size but selective on fit.

## Marketing Analytics & Measurement

**Dashboards people trust. Metrics that drive decisions.**

Analytics implementations fail for two reasons: the underlying data is wrong, or the reporting doesn't answer the questions people actually have. We fix both.

**What we build:** Attribution models that reflect how your business actually acquires customers, not how the platforms want to take credit. LTV and cohort analyses that inform acquisition efficiency decisions. Executive dashboards that answer "how are we doing" without requiring a data team to interpret. Marketing mix models for companies with enough scale and channel diversity.

**What we use:** Looker, Metabase, or whatever BI tool you already have. We'll use spreadsheets if that's what makes sense for your stage. The tool matters less than the thinking behind it.

**What we don't do:** We're not a data warehouse implementation shop. If you need to build a full modern data stack from scratch, we can advise on architecture and recommend specialists, but that's not our core work. We operate at the analytics and measurement layer, assuming reasonably clean data exists or can be created.

## How engagements typically work

**Infrastructure Audit:** 2-3 weeks, fixed scope. The diagnostic that tells you what's broken and what to fix first. Often leads to implementation work, but no obligation.

**Implementation Projects:** Scope and timeline vary based on complexity. Tracking overhauls typically run 4-8 weeks. Martech integrations depend on the systems involved. We scope tightly and communicate constantly.

**Ongoing Retainers:** For paid acquisition management and continuous analytics support. Monthly commitment, typically 20-40 hours depending on channel complexity and spend level. Flexible to scale up or down as needs change.

**Pricing:** Time and materials, always. We'll estimate ranges upfront, but we don't pretend project-based pricing makes sense for work that's inherently iterative. You pay for the time we spend, and we're transparent about where that time goes.

## Is this a fit?

Softpath works best with companies that have some traction but aren't sure they can trust their numbers. You've got customers, you're spending on acquisition, but you suspect you're leaving money on the table because your measurement is broken or your tools don't work together.

You're probably not a fit if you're pre-product-market-fit and need to figure out who your customer is, if you need a full-service agency to handle creative production, or if you're looking for someone to "just run the ads" without caring about measurement.

If you're unsure, [let's talk](/contact). A 30-minute conversation will tell us both whether there's something here.
