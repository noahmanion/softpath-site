# The short version

Softpath is a fractional growth and analytics consultancy. We help companies fix their marketing infrastructure, run paid acquisition that actually scales, and build measurement systems they can trust.

We work primarily with B2C and B2B2C companies who have outgrown their scrappy early-stage setup but aren't ready for (or don't want) a full in-house growth team.

# Who's behind Softpath

Noah Ketner founded Softpath after 13+ years in growth, analytics, and marketing operations roles across startups and agencies.

The pattern was always the same: companies would hire for paid acquisition or analytics, but the real problem was upstream. Tracking was broken. Tools didn't talk to each other. The data in the dashboard didn't match the data in the CRM didn't match the data in the ad platforms. Everyone was making decisions based on numbers they didn't trust.

Softpath exists to fix that. We start with the infrastructure, get the measurement right, and then help you scale acquisition with confidence.

**Background highlights:**

Noah has managed paid spend from $1K to $1M+ monthly across Meta, Google, and TikTok. He's rebuilt analytics implementations for companies who thought their tracking was fine (it wasn't). He's built attribution models, LTV analyses, and executive dashboards that actually get used.

Before Softpath, Noah led growth and analytics at early-stage startups and worked agency-side managing multi-channel acquisition for B2C brands. He's been the person in the room explaining to the CFO why the numbers don't add up, and he's been the person who fixed them.

# How we work

Softpath operates as a fractional partner, not a vendor. We embed with your team, understand your business, and work on the problems that actually matter.

Most engagements start with an infrastructure audit. We look at your tracking setup, your martech stack, and your paid acquisition program. We identify what's broken, what's missing, and what's costing you money you don't realize you're losing.

From there, we either fix it ourselves or help your team fix it. Some clients keep us on retainer for ongoing paid management and analytics support. Others bring us in for specific projects and then run independently.

We price on time and materials, not deliverables. Growth work is iterative. The scope changes as you learn. Arbitrary project boundaries don't serve anyone.
