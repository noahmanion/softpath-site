## Marketing Infrastructure Audit

<div class="highlight-box">
  <p>Before you scale spend or buy another tool, find out if your current setup is telling you the truth.</p>
</div>

In 2-3 weeks, I'll audit your tracking, martech stack, and paid accounts, then give you a prioritized roadmap to fix what's broken.

### What's Included

**Tracking & Attribution Assessment**

<ul class="feature-list feature-list--check">
  <li>Pixel and tag implementation review (Meta, Google, TikTok, GA4, GTM)</li>
  <li>Event taxonomy and conversion tracking validation</li>
  <li>Attribution gap analysis</li>
  <li>Cross-platform data consistency check</li>
</ul>

**Martech Stack Assessment**

<ul class="feature-list feature-list--check">
  <li>Tool inventory: what you have, what you're paying, what's actually used</li>
  <li>Data flow mapping: how data moves between systems (or doesn't)</li>
  <li>Configuration review for core platforms</li>
  <li>Recommendations: keep, fix, consolidate, or kill</li>
</ul>

**Paid Acquisition Audit**

<ul class="feature-list feature-list--check">
  <li>Account structure evaluation across active platforms</li>
  <li>Spend efficiency analysis (90-day or 6-month window depending on sales cycle)</li>
  <li>Creative and audience organization review</li>
  <li>Measurement validation: do platform numbers match reality?</li>
</ul>

### What You Get

<ul class="feature-list">
  <li>Written report with findings and supporting data</li>
  <li>Slide deck for stakeholders</li>
  <li>Live walkthrough call to review findings and discuss next steps</li>
  <li>Prioritized 90-day action plan</li>
</ul>

</div>

<div class="section-block">

## Martech Implementation

After the audit, I can implement the fixes: tracking setup, tool configuration, data flow fixes, and integrations.

**Tools I work with:**

<ul class="tools-list">
  <li>Segment</li>
  <li>GA4 / GTM</li>
  <li>Klaviyo</li>
  <li>HubSpot</li>
  <li>ActiveCampaign</li>
  <li>Attio</li>
</ul>

</div>

<div class="section-block">

## Paid Acquisition Management

I manage paid campaigns across Meta, Google, and TikTok, optimized to real business metrics, not platform ROAS.

**What makes this different:**

<ul class="feature-list feature-list--check">
  <li>Campaigns tied to actual CAC, LTV, and payback period</li>
  <li>Reporting that connects ad spend to revenue</li>
  <li>Structure and creative testing that compounds over time</li>
</ul>

I work on a retainer basis with companies who have completed the infrastructure audit or already have solid measurement in place.

## Marketing Analytics & LTV Modeling

For companies ready to go deeper, I build cohort analysis, LTV projections, and unit economics models that inform acquisition strategy.

This isn't a dashboard project. It's the analytical backbone that tells you which customers are worth acquiring and how much you should pay to get them.
