Timeblock is a minimalist time-blocking app designed for focused work sessions.

Most calendar apps are built for scheduling meetings. Timeblock is built for scheduling yourself. Create time blocks for deep work, set intentions for each block, and get gentle nudges when it's time to transition.

No integrations. No AI. Just a simple tool for the simple practice of deciding what you're going to work on and then working on it.
