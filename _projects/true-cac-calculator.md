Most companies calculate CAC wrong. They divide ad spend by new customers and call it a day. But that misses agency fees, creative costs, tooling, and the salary of everyone touching the acquisition funnel.

The True CAC Calculator walks you through all the costs that should be included, helps you allocate shared costs appropriately, and gives you a number you can actually trust for unit economics decisions.

Download the spreadsheet, fill in your numbers, and see what your real CAC looks like.
